# Code of Conduct

RSdropinUK is a community activity intended for education and collaboration in the research software community.

We value the participation of each community member and want our participants and volunteers to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout our drop-in sessions and associated activities.

To make clear what is expected, all participants, organisers, and volunteers at any RSdropinUK event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code.

## Our Community

Members of the RSdropinUK community are open, considerate, and respectful. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- Being open. Members of the community are open to collaboration.
- Focusing on what is best for the community. We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
- Acknowledging time and effort. We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the research software community. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
- Showing empathy towards other community members. We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
- Being considerate. Members of the community are considerate of their peers.
- Being respectful. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The RSdropinUK community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

## Inappropriate Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of any participants in any form

- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
